I gathered data from FBRef, a comprehensive football statistics website, using P𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗲𝗯 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗕𝗲𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗽. The script extracts team, players, match data for the 2024/2025 season.

Since the data was already clean before web scraping, minimal data cleaning was required. I remembered I only changed the data types of the columns before loading them into the model.

During this dashboard development, I primarily use DAX to create new measures for my visuals. Also, I also use Power Query to create calculated columns or edit data when there was something wrong with my measures.

My biggest challenge in this project was 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱, especially when it came to representing 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀' 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀. Deciding 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀 𝘁𝗼 use was quite challenging. It took me a few days of research and exploring different ideas online to refine the design.

Hope you like it, and feel free to connect if you’re interested in data science/ data analytics, or just love football and Manchester United as much as I do! (erh...Manchester United performs so badly this season, hope my team won’t regelate 😥)
